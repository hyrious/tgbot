    - name: blockquote
      content: |-
        Example: A poll bot for groups runs in privacy mode (only receives commands, replies to its messages and mentions). There could be two ways to create a new poll:

        Explain the user how to send a command with parameters (e.g. /newpoll question answer1 answer2). May be appealing for hardcore users but lacks modern day polish.
        Guide the user through a step-by-step process. 'Please send me your question', 'Cool, now let's add the first answer option', 'Great. Keep adding answer options, then send /done when you're ready'.

        The last option is definitely more attractive. And if you use ForceReply in your bot's questions, it will receive the user's answers even if it only receives replies, commands and mentions - without any extra work for the user.
    table:
    - Field: force_reply
      Type: 'True'

    content: 'Your bot can offer users HTML5 games to play solo or to compete against each other in groups and one-on-one chats. Create games via @BotFather using the /newgame command.

    - Games are a new type of content on Telegram, represented by the Game and InlineQueryResultGame objects.
    - Once you've created a game via BotFather, you can send games to chats as regular messages using the sendGame method, or use inline mode with InlineQueryResultGame.
    - If you send the game message without any buttons, it will automatically have a 'Play GameName' button. When this button is pressed, your bot gets a CallbackQuery with the game_short_name of the requested game. You provide the correct URL for this particular user and the app opens the game in the in-app browser.
    - 'You can manually add multiple buttons to your game message. Please note that the first button in the first row must always launch the game, using the field callback_game in InlineKeyboardButton. You can add extra buttons according to taste: e.g., for a description of the rules, or to open the game''s official community.'
    - To make your game more attractive, you can upload a GIF animation that demostrates the game to the users via BotFather (see Lumberjack for example).
    - A game message will also display high scores for the current chat. Use setGameScore to post high scores to the chat with the game, add the edit_message parameter to automatically update the message with the current scoreboard.
    - Use getGameHighScores to get data for in-game high score tables.
    - You can also add an extra sharing button for users to share their best score to different chats.
    - For examples of what can be done using this new stuff, check the @gamebot and @gamee bots.
